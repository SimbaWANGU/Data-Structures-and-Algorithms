Stack follows the principle of LIFO (last In, first out).

If you stack books, the top book will be taken before the bottom one. When you browse on the internet, the back button leads you to the most recently browsed page.

Available methods for a Stack are:
  - push: Input a new element.
  - pop : Remove the top element, return the removed element.
  - peek : Return the top element.
  - length : Return the number of element(s) in the stack.
