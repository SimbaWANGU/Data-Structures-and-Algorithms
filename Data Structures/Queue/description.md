# Queue

## Queue uses the FIFO principle (first in, first out).

In other words, when you queue for the bus, the first in the queue will always board first.

Queue methods are the following:
  - enqueue: Enter queue, add an element at the end.
  - dequeue: Leave queue, remove the front element and return it.
  - front: Get the first element.
  - isEmpty: Determine whether the queue is empty.
  - size: Get the number of element(s) in queue.
