# Remove duplicates in sorted array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Example 
[1,1,2,3] => [1,2,3]
[1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5] => [1,2,3,4,5]
['a', 'b', 'b'] => ['a', 'b']
